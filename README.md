# Hate-Speech-Detection-of-banjar-Languange 

This research aims to construct a dataset of Banjarese language hate speech and determine the best combination of feature extraction techniques and machine learning models for detecting Banjarese hate speech. The method employed for this study involves several steps, including data collection, data filtering and annotation, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and evaluation. Various techniques are used for feature extraction, such as Word N-Gram, TF-IDF, a combination of Word N-Gram and TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Glove. The result of this study reveals that the combination of TF-IDF for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine as the model achieves exceptional performance. The average Recall, Precision, Accuracy, and F1-Score scores exceed 90%, demonstrating the model's ability to identify Banjarese hate speech accurately. A demonstration of the model with the best accuracy can be accessed at the following link.
